<h2> PREFACE </h2>
	 <p>What did you think about TPOT 3? I heard some people liked it, but didn't enjoy the pacing. I just didn't like 90 percent of it. A bunch of jokes drawn out horribly, lame characterisation........ 
	 This was more of a let-down as TPOT 2 had well accomplished in making us remember most of the unpopular characters. Granted, it had much more time to do so. Epic/Fuzzy later asked me to try rewriting like YAG 6. 
	 I realised characterising a cast who I barely know 10% of into a less than an hour "episode" is a scary ordeal for one person! After creating this, Epic did like it, and so did others, reassuringly! 
	 Although i must make it clear that I do not believe this is the best, superior version of TPOT 3. This is only my version, and I hope you enjoy! Made in 3-4 days.</p>

	<h2> AFTERTHOUGHTS </h2>
	 <p> A  lot of elements from the YAG rewrite show here. Animals, mostly! I was targeting some of my own negative aspects from TPOT 3. The fact that Golf Ball would for some reason choose to not wear the challenge-deciding helmet of creation is such an odd choice in the original. Also, I appreciate the original
	 trying to make Eraser go harder on his joke, but killing people with the raygun is not fun to see him do. I made him acknowledge opposition instead, to continue the joke. By the way, speaking of gaty! Did you like the new characterisations of the characters? A bunch I made up because of their tiny amounts of screentime in the
	 original TPOT! Pillow is based off of instinct rather than thought, Gaty defends, Grassy is a bit of a flowy guy, Nickel is a shy artistic type, and more. I can see why it's so difficult to make these TPOT episodes when you hardly have character. Who thought that many contestants would be a good idea? I hope you enjoyed, and perhaps when you and I are 70 years old TPOT will end. Thank you!
